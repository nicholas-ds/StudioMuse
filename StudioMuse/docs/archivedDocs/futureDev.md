# StudioMuse Tools: Future Development Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the vision and development plan for new StudioMuse tools beyond the initial ColorBitMagic plugin. These tools will enhance the artist's workflow through precise measurement, AI-assisted composition, and reference image processing.

## 1. Measuring & Scaling Tool Plugin

### Purpose
Create a comprehensive measurement system that bridges the gap between digital imagery and physical artwork, allowing artists to accurately plan and execute physical pieces.

### Key Features
- **Measurement Creation**: Read from GIMP's built-in vector lines or create custom measurements
- **Measurement Organization**: Group, name, and reorder measurements
- **Unit Conversion**: Auto-convert between pixel and real-world units (inches, cm)
- **Visual Markup**: Toggleable overlay layer showing measurements
- **Data Persistence**: Export/import functionality for reuse across projects

### Implementation Approach
- Build on the data storage patterns from ColorBitMagic
- Leverage GIMP's vector tools for initial measurement creation
- Create a clean, organized UI for measurement management

### MVP Requirements
- Basic measurement creation and labeling
- Pixel-to-real-world conversion with configurable ratio
- Measurement persistence between sessions
- Simple visual overlay system

## 2. Vision Lab (AI-Assisted Tools)

  - Suggest underpainting colors for desired final effects

### Implementation Approach
- Build on ColorBitMagic's existing palette functionality
- Incorporate color theory algorithms
- Integrate with physical paint properties database

## 4. Structure & Composition Tools

### Purpose
Provide tools that help artists analyze, plan, and execute well-structured compositions.

### Key Features
- **Golden Ratio/Rule of Thirds Overlay**:
  - Interactive compositional guide overlays
  - Custom grid systems
  - Dynamic perspective guides

- **Tonal Distribution Analyzer**:
  - Visualize value patterns across the composition

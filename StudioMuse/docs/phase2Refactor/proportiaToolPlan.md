# Proportia Measurement Tool ‚Äî Planning Document

## Overview

**Proportia** is a measurement and scaling tool designed to work within the GIMP 3.0 plugin suite *StudioMuse*. It enables artists to capture, annotate, organize, and scale dimensions from digital images to real-world canvas sizes. Inspired by the `scaleArt.py` prototype, it brings structured canvas planning and measuring directly into GIMP with future AI integration.

## Measurement Mode Workflow

### Activation üöß
- User clicks a button to enter **Measurement Mode**.
- In this mode, clicking two points on the image creates a measurement.
- **PLANNED**: Upcoming implementation.

### Capture Flow üöß
- A line is drawn between the two points.
- When the user completes the second click, a **popup dialog appears near the cursor** with:
  - The detected pixel measurement: `112 px`
  - Converted real-world dimensions: `3.5 cm` (based on current scaling settings)
  - A dropdown for selecting or creating a measurement group
  - Two action buttons:
    - **[Save]**: Finalizes the measurement and adds it to the selected group
    - **[Cancel]**: Discards the current measurement, allowing the user to start over
- The popup is positioned contextually near where the measurement was taken, minimizing mouse travel
- Once saved, the measurement is added to the corresponding group and its markup layer
- If a markup layer doesn't exist for the group, it is auto-created.
- **PLANNED**: Core functionality for next implementation phase.

### Overlay Layers üöß
- Each group has its **own markup layer** (e.g., "Face Measurements").
- Lines are added to the corresponding group layer.
- User can toggle visibility of any group's overlay.
- **PLANNED**: To be implemented with measurement mode.

### Customization üöß

  - `Gtk.Entry`: Measurement name
  - `Gtk.ComboBoxText`: Select or create a group
  - `Gtk.CheckButton`: Toggle to add visual label
  - `Gtk.ColorButton`: Choose line color
  - `Gtk.Scale` or `Gtk.SpinButton`: Select line thickness
  - `Gtk.ButtonBox`: [Save] and [Cancel] buttons
- The popup is positioned with `Gtk.Window(type=Gtk.WindowType.POPUP)` and `.move(x, y)` based on the click.
- If popup fails, fallback to sidebar input with pre-filled data.
- **PLANNED**: Core popup functionality designed but not yet implemented.

## Future Integration Considerations

To ensure Proportia works seamlessly with the upcoming Project Selection System and Palette Generator, we need to build forward-compatibility into the initial design. This preemptive planning will minimize refactoring later and create a more cohesive experience across the StudioMuse suite.

### üåü Project Selection System Integration

#### 1. Path Abstraction Layer ‚úÖ
- Implement a `get_storage_path()` method that centralizes all file path logic
- This approach prevents hardcoding paths throughout the codebase
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Using `get_plugin_storage_path()` from `file_io.py`

```python
def get_measurements_file_path(self) -> str:
    """Get the path to the measurements file"""
    file_path = get_plugin_storage_path("data/tools/structure/saved_dimensions.json", "studiomuse")
    return file_path
```

**Why this matters now:**
Without this abstraction, we would hardcode paths throughout the codebase. When the Project Selection System is implemented later, we would need to update every file operation to include project-specific paths (e.g., `.../projects/{project_id}/measurements/...`). By using `get_storage_path()` from the beginning, we'll only need to update this single method to make all file operations project-aware. This is a classic example of the "Single Responsibility Principle" that significantly reduces future refactoring effort.

#### 2. Project-Aware Data Models ‚úÖ
- Include `project_id` field in measurement data structures
- Group measurements with metadata that allows filtering by project
- **IMPLEMENTED**: `MeasurementCollection` class supports project metadata

```python
@dataclass
class MeasurementCollection:
    """Model for a collection of related measurements."""
    name: str
    measurements: List[Measurement] = field(default_factory=list)
    description: Optional[str] = None
    created_date: str = field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now().isoformat())
    version: str = "1.0.0"
```

#### 3. UI Design Considerations ‚öôÔ∏è
- Reserve UI space for displaying active project context
- Design list views to support future filtering by project
- Create a standardized toolbar area where project selector could later appear
- **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**: UI architecture allows for future extensions

### üé® Palette Generator Integration üöß

#### 1. Color System Compatibility üöß
- Use consistent color models that will work with Palette Generator
- Implement shared color utilities for both tools
- **PLANNED**: CSS structure in place for future implementation

```python
def rgb_to_hex(r, g, b):
    """Convert RGB values to hex color string"""
    return f"#{r:02x}{g:02x}{b:02x}"
    
def hex_to_rgb(hex_color):
    """Convert hex color string to RGB tuple"""
    hex_color = hex_color.lstrip('#')
    return tuple(int(hex_color[i:i+2], 16) for i in (0, 2, 4))
```

#### 2. Measurement-Color Association üöß
- Allow measurements to optionally link to palette colors
- Create data structure for cross-referencing measurements with palette entries
- Enables coordinated visual presentation (e.g., colored measurement lines that match palette)
- **PLANNED**: Data models support extension for this feature

#### 3. Shared Resource System ‚úÖ
- Design measurement storage to be compatible with palette storage conventions
- Implement helpers for cross-tool asset discovery
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Consistent asset handling system

### ‚öôÔ∏è Cross-Tool Architecture

#### 1. Event Communication System üöß
- Implement basic observer pattern for tool events
- **PLANNED**: Designed but deferred until needed for specific cross-tool communication
```python
class EventBus:
    _subscribers = {}
    
    @classmethod
    def subscribe(cls, event_type, callback):
        if event_type not in cls._subscribers:
            cls._subscribers[event_type] = []
        cls._subscribers[event_type].append(callback)
        
    @classmethod
    def publish(cls, event_type, data=None):
        for callback in cls._subscribers.get(event_type, []):
            callback(data)
```

#### 2. Consistent Data Structures ‚úÖ
- Use JSON schemas that will be compatible across tools
- Include version fields in all data files to support future migrations
- Create data validators that can be reused by other tools
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Structured data models with validation

#### 3. Configuration System Integration ‚öôÔ∏è
- Structure Proportia's configuration to fit within the larger StudioMuse hierarchy
- **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**: Foundation in place
```json
{
  "proportia": {
    "default_unit": "cm",
    "precision": 2,
    "show_overlay": true
  },
  "projects": {
    "active_project": "my_project"
  }
}
```

### Why Plan Ahead?

Planning for these integrations now offers several key advantages:

1. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Building with future components in mind prevents costly refactoring later
2. **Consistent User Experience**: Creates a unified feel across all StudioMuse tools
3. **Faster Development**: Future tools can leverage patterns established in Proportia
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensures measurements remain associated with the correct projects and palettes
5. **Extensibility**: Makes it easier to add new features that span multiple tools

By incorporating these considerations into Proportia's initial design, we'll establish a strong foundation for the entire StudioMuse plugin suite while minimizing integration challenges later in development.

   - Add "NoseTip to Hairline" (9.35 cm)
   - Measure "Chin to NoseTip" (5.4 cm)

2. **Group and Organize**:
   - Assign all measurements to "Face" group
   - Position related measurements together (e.g., all lip measurements)
   - Toggle overlay to visualize proportions on the image

3. **Scale for New Canvas**:
   - Select target canvas size
   - Apply scaling to maintain face proportions
   - Export new dimensions for physical artwork planning

- The popup remains open until the user chooses an action
- If [Save] is clicked, the line is permanently added to the measurement list and appropriate overlay layer
- If [Cancel] is clicked, the temporary line is removed and the user can start a new measurement
- Optional: The popup could also include a checkbox to "Add Visual Label" for displaying the name beside the line
